We bring a healing centred, intersectional and trauma-informed approach for organisations and individuals with emotional intelligence. \nThe truth is, most existing support models when it comes to diversity, equity, inclusion and wellbeing are reactive, not proactive. Those models werenâ€™t built with the needs of minoritised employees in mind. When people donâ€™t feel safe or seen, they disengage because the support doesn't understand the different barriers, challenges and multi-layered discrimination that people experience. This impacts how they are at work and the lives they live. We provide the safe space that fosters united wellbeing.\nWith over 10 years global experience, Intersectional Healing as a Service, is our way of transforming leadership and bringing healing into our world. The healing circles are part of that transformation. \nJoin us in the movement!",

It provides in-depth insights, detailed graphs, and analytics to help you understand your browsing habits. You can even personalize your productivity by marking sites as productive or distracting.\n\nâœ¨ Key Features:\nâœ… Screen Time Tracking â€“ See your daily, weekly, and monthly stats, along with averages.\nâœ… Website Insights â€“ Get detailed analytics on where your time really goes.\nâœ… Personalized Productivity â€“ Customize which sites count as productive or distracting.\nâœ… Built-in Website Blocker â€“ Reduce distractions and stay on track.\n\nWhat started as a small project quickly turned into something bigger. Initially, I built it for myself, but then I decided to share it with the world. 100 people started using it, which gave me the motivation to improve it further. Now, with 400+ downloads and 200+ active users, itâ€™s growing every day!\n\nIt even got featured on the Chrome Web Store, which was a huge milestone! Hopefully, weâ€™ll hit four-digit users soon.\n\nThis journey has been fun and exciting, and Iâ€™d love for you to try it out! Let me know what you think. ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰",
